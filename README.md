# 🌌 Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 🌌

Unlock the mysteries of particle physics using machine learning! This project focuses on distinguishing signal from background events in the hunt for the elusive Higgs Boson, based on data from the ATLAS Experiment at CERN.

### 🌟 Project Overview
In this challenge, machine learning algorithms are trained to classify events as either *signal* (possible Higgs Boson detections) or *background* (non-Higgs events). The project offers hands-on experience with real-world scientific data and provides insights into applying ML techniques in high-energy physics.
